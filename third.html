          <p style="font-size:20px;"> 

             Tarsiers are found primarily in forested habitats, especially forests 
             that have liana, since the vine gives tarsiers vertical support when climbing 
             trees.Tarsiers are the only extant entirely carnivorous primates: they are 
             primarily insectivorous, and catch insects by jumping at them. Their favorite prey 
             are arthropods like beetles, spiders, cockroaches, grasshoppers, and walking sticks.
             They are also known to prey on birds, snakes, lizards, and bats.

         <p style="font-size:20px;">                            
            This pelican feeds almost entirely on fish. Preferred prey species can include common 
            carp (Cyprinus carpio), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), common rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus), 
            eels, catfish (especially silurids during winter), mullet and northern pike (Esox lucius), 
            the latter having measured up to 50 cm (20 in) when taken. In the largest remnant colony, 
            located in Greece, the preferred prey is reportedly the native Alburnus belvica.

          <h2><b><em><u>Numbat</u></em></b></h2>

          <p style="font-size:20px">                             
            Numbats live in Eucalypt woodlands where old and fallen trees provide hollow logs
            for shelter, nest sites and foraging opportunities. They forage in open areas 
            near the cover of shrubs. The trees provide some protection from birds of prey but 
            there needs to be space between the foliage for the sun to reach the forest floor 
            and warm the ground so the termites are active. The presence of Numbats is determined 
            by the sufficient presence and availability of its prey source, termites. Therefore,
            they do not occur in areas that are too wet or too cold for termites to flourish.

          <p style="font-size:20px">                               
            Arctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to 90–100 °C (160–180 °F) between the 
            external environment and their internal core temperature. To prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox 
            curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail. This position 
            gives the fox the smallest surface area to volume ratio and protects the least insulated areas.
            Arctic foxes also stay warm by getting out of the wind and residing in their dens.

          <h2><b><em><u>Elephant shrew</u></em></b></h2>

          <p style="font-size:20px">         
            Elephant shrews mainly eat insects, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and earthworms. 
            An elephant shrew uses its nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its 
            mouth, much like an anteater. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew 
            struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey to the ground with a forefoot. Then, turning 
            its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a dog chewing a bone.
            This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of worm drop to the ground; these are simply 
            flicked up with the tongue.

          <h2><b><em><u>Cozumel Raccoon</u></em></b></h2>

          <p style="font-size:20px;">                                
            The raccoons live in densities of about 17-27 individuals per km2., and inhabit 
            home ranges of around 67 hectares (170 acres) on average. However, individuals do 
            not appear to defend territories to any great extent, and their close relative, 
            the common raccoon, can exist at very high densities when food is abundant. Although 
            there have been no detailed studies of their reproductive habits, females seem to give 
            birth primarily between November and January, possibly with a second litter during 
            the summer months.

          <p style="font-size:20px">                              
            In the wild, the most common seeds and nuts consumed by Spix's were from Pinhão 
            (Jatropha pohliana var. mollissima) and Favela (Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus). However 
            these trees are colonizers, not native to the bird's habitat, so they could not have 
            been historical staples of the diet. Its diet also included seeds and nuts from Joazeiro
            (Ziziphus Joazeiro), Baraúna (Schinopsis brasiliensis), Imburana (Commiphora leptophloeos 
            or Bursera leptophloeos), Facheiro (Pilosocereus piauhyensis), Phoradendron species, 
            Caraibeira (Tabebuia caraiba).
