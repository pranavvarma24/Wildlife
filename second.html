         <p style="font-size:20px;">                         
            Tarsiers are haplorhine primates of the family Tarsiidae, 
            which is itself the lone extant family within the infraorder 
            Tarsiiformes. Although the group was once more widespread,
            all of its species living today are found in Maritime 
            Southeast Asia, specifically the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
            and Brunei.

            The Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) grows in the Karavasta 
            Lagoon and is one of the protected species in Albania as a special
            tourist attraction of the Myzeqean region. This big bird is the 
            largest of Pelicans and one of the largest bird species that exist today.

            The Numbat, also called the banded anteater, is a small endangered 
            marsupial animal native to parts of Australia. They have a long 
            sticky tongue that allows them pick up termites, which they eat exclusively. 
            The Numbat is under threat from habitat loss and introduced predators like 
            foxes and feral cats.

            The Arctic Fox is one of the most endearing animals in the Tundra region.
            It can change its fur from a thick white to a short brown coat depending
            on the season. The Arctic Fox has been declining in numbers due to over 
            hunting in some areas and the emergence of the large red fox in others. 
            Finland, Norway, and Sweden are some of the areas where the dwindling 
            population of Arctic foxes has been due to over hunting.

         <p style="font-size:20px">         
            Elephant shrews, also called jumping shrews or sengis, are small insectivorous
            mammals native to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the
            order Macroscelidea. Their traditional common English name "elephant shrew" 
            comes from a perceived resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of 
            an elephant, and their superficial similarity with shrews (family Soricidae) 
            in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that elephant
            shrews are not classified with true shrews, but are in fact more closely related
            to elephants than shrews.

            Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii), also known as the little blue macaw, 
            is a macaw species that was endemic to Brazil. It is a member of tribe 
            Arini in the subfamily Arinae (Neotropical parrots), part of the family Psittacidae
            (the true parrots). It was first described by German naturalist Georg Marcgrave.
            This bird has been completely extirpated from its natural range, and following 
            a several-year survey, the IUCN officially declared it extinct in the wild in 2019.
